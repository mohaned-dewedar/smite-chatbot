# Document Enhancement Roadmap

## Current Status: ✅ Critical Fixes Implemented

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (COMPLETED)
- [x] **Abilities**: Add god names to content for better searchability
- [x] **Abilities**: Add semantic keywords ("ultimate ability" vs "Type: Ultimate")  
- [x] **Gods**: Include ability names for cross-referencing

## Future Enhancement Phases

### Phase 2: Search Enhancement (TODO - Not Priority)
- [ ] **Items**: Add semantic tags
  - Add "defensive relic", "movement speed", "damage immunity" keywords
  - Process item stats into searchable categories
  - Example: Aegis → "invulnerable relic", "damage immunity item"

- [ ] **Patches**: Enrich with change summaries
  - Pull detailed changes from god_changes documents
  - Add buff/nerf/shift categorization to patch content
  - Include dates and impact summaries

- [ ] **Cross-references**: Better document linking
  - Link abilities to gods bidirectionally
  - Connect patches to specific god changes
  - Reference items in god build contexts

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (TODO - Future)
- [ ] **Stat-based search**: Process numeric values into categories
  - "High damage", "tanky", "fast", "mobile" god classifications
  - Item stat ranges: "high health", "attack speed items"
  
- [ ] **Synonym expansion**: Map user language to game terms
  - "Ultimate" → "4th ability", "ult"
  - "Tank" → "Guardian", "Solo"
  - "DPS" → "ADC", "Carry"
  
- [ ] **Context enrichment**: Enhanced metadata utilization
  - Role-based recommendations
  - Pantheon groupings for lore queries
  - Meta tier integration (if data available)

## Implementation Notes

### Current Document Quality Issues (Resolved)
- ✅ Achilles "Fatal Strike" now searchable with "achilles ultimate"
- ✅ All abilities include god names in content
- ✅ Ultimate abilities properly tagged with semantic keywords
- ✅ God documents reference their ability names

### Known Limitations (For Future Phases)
1. **Item Search**: Users asking "what items give movement speed" still need manual filtering
2. **Patch Details**: Patch documents are minimal, detailed changes live in separate documents
3. **Semantic Gaps**: Game-specific terminology not always mapped to user language
4. **Stats Processing**: Numeric values not categorized for qualitative searches

### Performance Impact
- Phase 1 changes: Minimal processing overhead, significant search improvement
- Future phases: Will require more complex processing but better user experience

## Test Cases Resolved
- ✅ "What is Achilles ultimate?" → Now finds "Fatal Strike"
- ✅ "Zeus ultimate" → Now finds "Lightning Storm" 
- ✅ "Show me Ares abilities" → Now properly cross-references

## Test Cases for Future Phases
- [ ] "What items give movement speed?" 
- [ ] "Show me defensive relics"
- [ ] "Which gods were buffed in patch 16?"
- [ ] "What are the Greek gods?"
- [ ] "Who is good for solo lane?"
