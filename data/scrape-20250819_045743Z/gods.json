The Morrigan retains her Jungle Buffs and Fire Giant buff while transformed, while also gaining the buffs that her transformation currently has. (excluding Elixir's, which she doesn't gain nor retain on transform.) The Morrigan can use the consumables of her selected Transformation, such as Wards, Runic Bomb, and Obsidian Dagger. Detransformation cleanses all currently applied Crowd Control effects, immediately causing The Morrigan to detransform. Transformation cleanses ALL effects, including allied ones such as Khepri's Ultimate, Scarab's Blessing. These effects are still applied to The Morrigan's base form, so if she dies while Blessed, she will immediately detransform and be revived."
