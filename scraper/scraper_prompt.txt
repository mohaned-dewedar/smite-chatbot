You're a structured data extractor. Given raw HTML from a SMITE 2 god's ability section, extract each ability as a structured JSON object.

Each ability should include:
- name (string)
- type (string: e.g. Passive, 1st Ability, etc.)
- description (string)
- stats (dictionary of stat name to stat value)
- notes (string, optional)
- is_aspect (true if it's an Aspect, else false)

Return only a JSON array like:
[
  {{
    "name": "Shield of Achilles",
    "type": "1st Ability",
    "description": "...",
    "stats": {{
      "Cost": "60 mana",
      "Cooldown": "12s"
    }},
    "notes": "...",
    "is_aspect": false
  }},
  ...
]

Here is the HTML:
{html}
